# Gubi-AI
## Realtime AI math tutor

This tool acts as a live tutor, integrated with text-to-speech. It converts handwritten math, captured through the webcam, to Latex and then solves the question with Wolfram Alpha. 
This "correct solution" is used to compare with the student's solution and provide feedback to the student's approach, guiding them towards the right answer.

Built using OpenAI, Mathpix and Wolfram Alpha on streamlit.
